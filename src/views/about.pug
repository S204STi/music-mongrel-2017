		Steve and Randy, the Founders of TMM, are die-hard music lovers and they bring broad experiences in promoting independent concerts throughout Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming. These shows have been produced in a wide range of venues, from large outdoor amphitheaters to intimate rooms, and from state-of-the-art concert halls to historic churches.  Rounding out their musical background is experience in artist management, tour management, and artist booking.
