		The Music Mongrel (TMM) is an ambitious venture to bring musical artists, diverse venues, and the regional community together. Nationally and internationally-recognized performers will be presented live in concert, and occasionally paired with local talent. “Genres” will be less important in this venture than great art. TMM’s vision is to inspire the audience as well as the artists, with new latitudes to express and appreciate the rich gift of music.

		Steve and Randy, the Founders of TMM, are die-hard music lovers and they bring broad experiences in promoting independent concerts throughout Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming. These shows have been produced in a wide range of venues, from large outdoor amphitheaters to intimate rooms, and from state-of-the-art concert halls to historic churches.  Rounding out their musical background is experience in artist management, tour management, and artist booking.
